# Star Wars: The Non-Profit Game
## Made by Zaeem Ghauri

### What is this?

This project was submitted as my final assignment for my grade 12 computer programming class. It was my first ever experience with programming and a lot of it was self-taught, quick-and-easy fixes, hence why the code looks... like that. It was developed in Java using multiple libraries centered around graphical user interface. The project itself is an old school, Galaga-type shooter game with a Star Wars theme. Despite the poor code, the game plays very well and to this day I'm proud of what I accomplished and wanted to share it with others. 

### Set Up

The set up for this project is fairly easy:

1. Pull or copy and paste the "StarWarsGame" file from the repository it into a new project/class using a Java IDE of your choice.
   
   *NOTE: You must run the progam with an older Java since applet's only work with jdk-8 and below. I'd recommend the "ReadyToProgram" IDE if you are not a programmer and simply want to play the game.*
   
2. Follow <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z-X09ZHRQ-5biIMKvnJcdgYUXVnU3t4M?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this link</a> to a folder of the game's assets and  
   download them. 
   
3. Place the game's code (from step 1) in the same folder as the assets.

4. Open the game's code and at the very beginning edit the CLASSNAME and the "path" variable.
   - change the CLASSNAME to match the name of the class you created with your IDE
   - change the "path" to the address of the "highscore.txt" file in the folder in which the game is saved.
